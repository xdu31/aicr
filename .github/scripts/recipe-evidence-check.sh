# Recipe-evidence gate: discover leaf overlays affected by a PR diff,
# then per affected recipe check for an evidence pointer, verify the
# bundle, and compare its signed digest against the current recipe's
# canonical digest. Writes a Markdown report; never blocks the PR.
#
# A recipe is "affected" when the PR touches its overlay, an ancestor
# overlay in its base chain, a referenced component values file, a
# *changed* registry component it transitively references, or any of its
# per-source evidence pointers (recipes/evidence/<slug>/<source>/<digest>.yaml)
# — so a pointer-only "refresh evidence" PR is verified rather than silently
# skipped.
#
# The report separates "protected" recipes — those with a committed
# pointer in recipes/evidence/, the set the gate actively verifies — from
# "other affected" recipes that have no evidence yet (best-effort, not a
# warning). This keeps a broad-impact PR from rendering dozens of alarming
# "missing" rows for recipes nobody has produced evidence for.
#
# Required env:
#   AICR        path to the aicr binary (built from a trusted source)
#   BASE_SHA    PR base SHA (target branch tip at PR creation)
#   HEAD_SHA    PR head SHA (PR branch tip; must be locally reachable)
#   REPORT_OUT  destination path for the Markdown report
#
# Optional env:
#   REPO_URL    base URL for absolute links in the report (e.g.
#               https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr); when unset, the
#               trust-model link in the trailer is omitted
#   MAX_ROWS    cap on protected-recipe rows (default 80) to keep the
#               report under GitHub's ~65KB comment-body cap
#
# Local invocation:
#   make build  # or `go build -o ./bin/aicr ./cmd/aicr`
#   AICR=./bin/aicr \
#   BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD) \
#   HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) \
#   REPORT_OUT=/tmp/report.md \
#   .github/scripts/recipe-evidence-check.sh
#
# Known limitations (tracked as follow-ups):
#   * The recipe directory slug is computed as `basename overlay .yaml`,
#     while `aicr validate --emit-attestation` derives it from criteria
#     (RecipeNameFor). Overlays not following the canonical naming will be
#     reported as missing-pointer. (The per-source <source>/<digest> levels
#     below the slug are discovered by glob, so any number of contributors'
#     pointers are verified.)
#   * Discovery walks `spec.base` ancestors but not `spec.mixins`, and
#     promote-all only matches recipes/registry.yaml or recipes/
#     overlays/base.yaml. Mixin/check/component edits outside literal
#     valuesFile refs are not promoted. Parity with kwok-recipes.
#   * `aicr evidence verify` fetches OCI artifacts from PR-controlled
#     URLs; an allow-list of trusted registries is a follow-up.
