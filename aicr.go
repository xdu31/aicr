// Package aicr is the stable, public Go library surface for external
// consumers of the AI Cluster Runtime.
//
// External projects should import THIS package and use the types and
// constructors re-exported here. The underlying pkg/* packages are
// public and will remain importable, but this facade is the contract
// the project commits to via semver.
//
// # Example
//
//	client, err := aicr.NewClient(
//	    aicr.WithRecipeSource(aicr.FilesystemSource("/etc/aicr/recipes")),
//	)
//	if err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//	defer client.Close()
//
//	result, err := client.ResolveRecipe(ctx, aicr.RecipeRequest{
//	    Service:     "eks",
//	    Region:      "us-east-1",
//	    Accelerator: "h100",
//	    Nodes:       8, // worker-node count, not GPU count
//	    Intent:      "training",
//	})
//
// # Stability
//
// This package's exported API follows semver. The underlying pkg/*
// packages may introduce breaking changes between minor releases; if
// you depend on them directly, pin AICR to a patch version and audit
// upgrades.
//
// # Concurrency and Client lifecycle
//
// Each Client owns its own DataProvider and per-DataProvider cached
// metadata store and component registry. Multiple Clients constructed
// from different sources can resolve recipes concurrently without
// clobbering each other — a property multi-tenant consumers (e.g., a
// controller managing one Client per per-tenant configuration) rely
// on. This is a v0.12+ guarantee; earlier facade builds mutated a
// process-global DataProvider via recipe.SetDataProvider and were
// unsafe to construct concurrently.
//
// **Retain and reuse Client instances.** The recipe package keys its
// internal caches on DataProvider identity (pointer-equality of the
// interface value). Each call to NewClient builds a fresh
// DataProvider, so two Clients constructed from the same recipe
// source still produce distinct cache entries and do their own
// directory walk on first use. Long-running consumers should cache
// Clients keyed by their configuration (e.g., a content hash of the
// recipe-source settings) rather than constructing one per request.
//
// **Call Close when done.** When a Client is no longer needed
// (cache eviction, controller shutdown), call Close to drop its
// metadata store and component registry from the recipe package's
// internal caches. Without this, memory grows monotonically with
// the number of unique DataProviders ever observed.
//
// See docs/integrator/go-library.md for the integration guide.

// recipe must come from a prior Client.ResolveRecipe call on this
// Client — it carries the unexported internal recipe state needed to
// drive constraint evaluation. Passing a RecipeResult constructed by
// the caller (or one produced by a different Client whose internal
// has since been evicted) returns ErrCodeInvalidRequest.
//
// snap is the Snapshot returned by Client.CollectSnapshot or by any
// other snapshotter source.
//
// opts configure the validator run. Pass WithValidationNoCluster(true)
// from unit tests so no Kubernetes resources are created and every
// check reports as "skipped". WithValidationNamespace, WithValidationRunID,
// WithValidationCleanup, WithValidationTolerations, and
// WithValidationNodeSelector cover the production-controller knobs.
//
// Errors:
//   - ErrCodeInvalidRequest when the Client, recipe, or snap is nil,
//     when recipe lacks internal state, or when the Client has been
//     Closed.
//   - All validator errors propagate unwrapped — readiness-check
//     failures surface as ErrCodeInvalidRequest, infrastructure
//     failures as ErrCodeInternal.
//
// Phase-by-phase short-circuiting matches pkg/validator.ValidatePhases:
// when one phase fails, subsequent phases are reported as skipped
// rather than executed. Callers wanting per-phase control can
// reach into pkg/validator.ValidatePhase directly.

//     extra read per cancellation, not the whole remaining list.
//   - ErrCodeInternal when the component name isn't present on the
//     internal RecipeResult (would be a builder bug).
