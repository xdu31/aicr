// Package health computes per-recipe structural health across the whole
// criteria matrix, as specified by ADR-009 (Recipe Health Tracking).
//
// # Overview
//
// Compute enumerates every leaf recipe in the catalog and scores each
// against a set of hermetic, offline, deterministic signals — reproducible
// from a checkout with no GPU, no network, and no wall-clock. The V1 core
// (this package) ships the enumeration→resolution loop, the graded resolves
// signal, the per-recipe status rollup, and a byte-deterministic report.
//
// # Standalone package
//
// health is a standalone package rather than living in pkg/recipe to keep a
// future evidence-driven validation axis acyclic: pkg/evidence/attestation
// already imports pkg/recipe, so hosting health in pkg/recipe would later
// close a recipe → evidence → recipe import cycle once health consumes
// evidence. A standalone package depending on both stays acyclic.
//
// # Signals and rollup
//
// Each leaf is scored on graded dimensions whose per-dimension state is one
// of pass, warn, fail, or unknown. Three graded dimensions ship today:
// resolves (whether the recipe builder resolves the criteria without error),
// chart_pinned (whether every resolved Helm component references an explicit
// chart version — ADR-006 layer 1, a pure field read with no Helm render), and
// constraints_wellformed (whether every merged constraint parses with the
// snapshot-free constraint parsers — fail — and whether the constraint-aware
// resolution surfaced composition warnings — warn). Each feeds the same
// generic rollup without changing rollup logic.
//
// constraints_wellformed is parse-only well-formedness and hermetic: the leaf
// is resolved through the constraint-aware path with a satisfied stub
// evaluator, so the signal never replays a constraint against cluster or
// snapshot state. Its fail grade (a constraint that does not parse) is the
// load-bearing signal; the warn grade reads ConstraintWarnings/ExcludedOverlays
// but, because the stub fails no constraint, does not fire under the current
// hermetic resolution (it is retained for forward-compatibility — see
// classifyConstraintsWellformed). Value semantics and snapshot-dependent
// constraint replay are deferred to the evidence-driven validation axis
// (ADR-009 coverage_declared_vs_run).
//
// declared_coverage is a separate descriptor, not a graded dimension: it
// records, per validation phase, whether the phase is declared, its named
// checks, and its constraint count. It is surfaced but never moves the status,
// so a deliberately minimal recipe is not penalized for declaring fewer checks.
//
// The rolled-up per-recipe status is fail if any graded dimension fails,
// else warn if any warns, else unknown if any is held (transient resolver
// errors are held rather than penalized — re-run rather than mark fail),
// else pass. unknown is a representable value, never an empty field a
// consumer could misread as pass.
//
// # Determinism
//
// There is no time.Now() on the computed path, so output is a pure function
// of the checkout. Report carries map-typed fields whose nondeterminism
// only manifests at marshal time; callers serializing the report must use
// serializer.MarshalYAMLDeterministic. The sole non-deterministic input is
// the unknown-from-transient mapping, which depends on real timeouts; tests
// inject errors via a fake DataProvider and assert byte-determinism on the
// non-error path only.
