// Package build defines the BuildSpec schema and the load / validate /
// write-back primitives used by the build pipeline. A BuildSpec is the
// Kubernetes-style document (apiVersion aicr.run/v1beta2, kind
// AICRRuntime) the runtime controller consumes: spec.* captures inputs
// (recipe, version, target, registry) and status.images is populated with
// the per-image registry/repository/tag/digest after a build.
//
// LoadSpec reads a spec file from disk under a bounded size cap, Validate
// enforces required fields, and WriteBack rewrites the file with updated
// status using a temp-file + rename so partially-written specs are never
// observable. The package itself does not push images; consumers compose
// it with pkg/oci to do the actual builds.
