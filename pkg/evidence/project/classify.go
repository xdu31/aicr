// sources count toward consensus; everything else is reported but
// contributes zero weight.

// Classification delegates to the shared authoritative loader in
// pkg/evidence/allowlist so the producer (GP2) and the GP4 consumer
// (pkg/corroborate) read the identical recipes/evidence/allowlist.yaml
// (owned by GP1, identityPattern/source schema) and classify a verified
// signer identically (#1505).
