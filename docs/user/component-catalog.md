# Component Catalog

AICR recipes are composed of components — the individual software packages that make up a GPU-accelerated Kubernetes runtime. This page lists every component that can appear in a recipe.

> ***Note:*** Components are included as appropriate in recipes. Not every component listed here will appear in a recipe.

The source of truth is [`recipes/registry.yaml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/recipes/registry.yaml). Each entry in the registry defines the component's Helm chart (or Kustomize source), default version, namespace, and node scheduling configuration. If a component is not listed there, it cannot appear in a recipe.

## Components

| Component | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **gpu-operator** | Manages the GPU driver and runtime lifecycle on Kubernetes nodes. Handles driver installation, container runtime configuration, device plugin, and GPU feature discovery. | [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator) |
| **network-operator** | Manages high-performance networking for GPU workloads. Configures RDMA, SR-IOV, and host networking for multi-node communication. | [NVIDIA Network Operator](https://github.com/Mellanox/network-operator) |
| **nfd** | Node Feature Discovery — labels nodes with hardware features (PCI device IDs, kernel modules, CPU capabilities). Both gpu-operator and network-operator consume these labels. On production GPU recipes, the Topology Updater publishes per-node `NodeResourceTopology` CRDs describing NUMA zones and GPU/NIC affinity for downstream NUMA-aware schedulers. | [Node Feature Discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery) |

| **cert-manager** | Automates TLS certificate management. Required by several operators for webhook and API server certificates. | [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) |
| **nodewright-operator** | OS-level node tuning and configuration management. Applies kernel parameters, sysctl settings, and system-level optimizations to nodes. | [Nodewright](https://github.com/nvidia/nodewright) |
| **nodewright-customizations** | Environment-specific node tuning profiles applied via Nodewright. Extends the operator with kernel params, hugepages, and other host-level configurations. | — |
| **nvsentinel** | GPU health monitoring and automated remediation. Detects GPU errors and can cordon or drain affected nodes. | [NVSentinel](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvsentinel) |
| **nvidia-dra-driver-gpu** | Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) driver for GPUs. Advertises GPUs via the Kubernetes `resource.k8s.io/v1` API instead of the legacy device plugin. Requires Kubernetes 1.34+ (DRA is GA in 1.34). See [AKS GPU Setup](../integrator/aks-gpu-setup.md#dynamic-resource-allocation-dra) for details. CLI alias: `dradriver`. | [NVIDIA DRA Driver](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-dra-driver-gpu) |

| **k8s-ephemeral-storage-metrics** | Exports ephemeral storage usage metrics per pod. Useful for monitoring scratch space consumption on GPU nodes. | [k8s-ephemeral-storage-metrics](https://github.com/jmcgrath207/k8s-ephemeral-storage-metrics) |
| **kai-scheduler** | DRA-aware gang scheduler with hierarchical queues and topology-aware placement. Ensures distributed training jobs land on nodes with optimal interconnect topology. | [KAI Scheduler](https://github.com/kai-scheduler/KAI-Scheduler) |
| **grove** | Pod lifecycle management for Dynamo inference platform. Installed as a standalone component. | [Grove](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/grove) |
| **dynamo-platform** | NVIDIA Dynamo inference serving platform with bundled CRDs. Distributed inference with prefix-cache-aware routing and disaggregated prefill/decode. | [Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) |
| **agentgateway-crds** | Custom Resource Definitions for agentgateway (Kubernetes Gateway API implementation for AI/ML inference). | [agentgateway](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway) |
| **agentgateway** | Kubernetes Gateway API implementation for AI/ML inference. Implements the Gateway API Inference Extension for model-aware ingress routing to InferencePool backends. | [agentgateway](https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway) |
| **k8s-nim-operator** | NVIDIA NIM Operator for managing NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) deployments on Kubernetes. | [K8s NIM Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-nim-operator) |

| **slinky-slurm-operator-crds** | Custom Resource Definitions for the SchedMD Slinky Slurm operator. Installs the `slinky.slurm.net` CRDs (Controller, NodeSet, LoginSet, Accounting, RestApi, Token). Installed separately to support CRD lifecycle management. | [Slinky Slurm Operator](https://github.com/SlinkyProject/slurm-operator) |
| **slinky-slurm-operator** | SchedMD Slinky Slurm operator and admission webhook. Manages the lifecycle of Slurm clusters declared via Slinky CRs. Cluster-instance CRs (Controller, NodeSet, LoginSet, ...) are user-authored — AICR ships only the operator, mirroring how dynamo-platform and kubeflow-trainer ship operator-only. | [Slinky Slurm Operator](https://github.com/SlinkyProject/slurm-operator) |

## How Components Are Selected

Not every component appears in every recipe. The recipe engine selects components based on the overlay chain for your environment:

- **Base components** (cert-manager, kube-prometheus-stack) appear in most recipes.
- **Cloud-specific components** (aws-efa, aws-ebs-csi-driver) are added when the service matches.
- **Intent-specific components** (agentgateway, agentgateway-crds) are added based on workload intent (e.g., inference recipes include the inference gateway).
- **Platform-specific components** (slinky-slurm-operator, kubeflow-trainer, dynamo-platform) are added when the recipe selects a matching `--platform`.
- **Accelerator/OS-specific tuning** (nodewright-customizations, nvidia-dra-driver-gpu) varies by hardware and OS combination.

### NFD Topology Updater

Production GPU leaf recipes (H100, GB200, RTX Pro 6000 on EKS / AKS / GKE / OKE / LKE) enable the NFD Topology Updater. It publishes per-node `NodeResourceTopology` CRDs that describe NUMA zones, GPU-to-NUMA affinity, and NIC-to-NUMA affinity. Runtime consumers (NUMA-aware schedulers, debugging via `kubectl get noderesourcetopologies`) can read these CRDs without further configuration.

The Topology Updater requires the kubelet `podResources` gRPC socket. The `KubeletPodResources` feature gate has been on by default since Kubernetes 1.15 (Beta) and reached GA in Kubernetes 1.28; AICR's recipe constraints on the affected leaves require K8s ≥ 1.30 or higher, so this is satisfied in practice. Recipes targeting Kubernetes < 1.15 must enable the feature gate explicitly. Kind / KWOK simulated clusters do not run a real kubelet and therefore leave the Topology Updater disabled — kind-based recipes will not see `NodeResourceTopology` CRDs.

See the upstream [Topology Updater docs](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/usage/nfd-topology-updater.html) for runtime consumer examples.

To see exactly which components appear in a given recipe, generate one:

```bash
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator h100 --os ubuntu --intent training -o recipe.yaml
```

The output lists every component with its pinned version and configuration values.

## Adding Components

New components are added declaratively in `recipes/registry.yaml` — no Go code required. See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Bundler Development](../contributor/component.md) docs for details.
