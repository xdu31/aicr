## Overview

Recipe metadata files define component configurations for GPU-accelerated Kubernetes deployments using a **base-plus-overlay architecture** with three composition mechanisms — single-parent inheritance, explicit mixin composition, and criteria-wildcard matching:

- **Base values** (`overlays/base.yaml`) - universal defaults
- **Intermediate recipes** (`eks.yaml`, `eks-training.yaml`) - shared configurations for categories
- **Leaf recipes** (`gb200-eks-ubuntu-training.yaml`) - hardware/workload-specific overrides
- **Mixins** (`mixins/*.yaml`) - composable fragments (OS constraints, platform components) that leaf overlays reference via `spec.mixins` instead of duplicating content
- **Criteria-wildcard overlays** (`gb200-any.yaml`) - cross-cutting overlays picked up automatically by the resolver when their wildcard criteria match the query, without being referenced via `spec.base` or `spec.mixins`
- **Inline overrides** - per-recipe customization without new files

Recipe files in `recipes/` are embedded at compile time. Integrators can extend or override using the `--data` flag (see [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics)).

For query matching and overlay merging internals, see [Data Architecture](../contributor/recipe.md).

## Recipe Structure

### Multi-Level Inheritance

Recipes use `spec.base` to inherit configurations. Chains progress from general (base) to specific (leaf):

```
base.yaml → eks.yaml → eks-training.yaml → gb200-eks-ubuntu-training.yaml
```

**Intermediate recipes** (partial criteria) capture shared configs:
```yaml
# eks-training.yaml
spec:
  base: eks
  criteria:
    service: eks
    intent: training  # Partial - no accelerator/OS
  componentRefs:
    - name: gpu-operator
      valuesFile: components/gpu-operator/values-eks-training.yaml
```

**Leaf recipes** (complete criteria) match user queries:
```yaml
# gb200-eks-ubuntu-training.yaml
spec:
  base: eks-training  # Inherits from intermediate
  criteria:
    service: eks
    accelerator: gb200
    os: ubuntu
    intent: training  # Complete
  componentRefs:
    - name: gpu-operator
      overrides:
        driver:
          version: "580.82.07"  # Hardware-specific override
```

**Leaf recipes with mixins** compose shared fragments:
```yaml
# h100-eks-ubuntu-training-kubeflow.yaml
spec:
  base: h100-eks-ubuntu-training
  mixins:
    - os-ubuntu          # Shared Ubuntu constraints (from recipes/mixins/)
    - platform-kubeflow  # Kubeflow trainer component (from recipes/mixins/)
  criteria:
    service: eks
    accelerator: h100
    os: ubuntu
    intent: training
    platform: kubeflow
```

Mixins use `kind: RecipeMixin` and carry only `constraints` and `componentRefs`. They live in `recipes/mixins/` and are applied after inheritance chain merging. See [Data Architecture](../contributor/recipe.md#mixin-composition) for details.

Some platforms declare their full component stack inline per leaf overlay rather than via a platform mixin. This is the case for `--platform slurm` and `--platform dynamo`, where each leaf carries hardware-specific tuning (GPU GRES strings, accelerator resource limits) that the mixin merge path cannot represent cleanly. Other shapes like `--platform kubeflow` and `--intent inference` still use the `platform-kubeflow` / `platform-inference` mixins shown above, since their leaf-specific tuning is minimal.

For example, `--platform slurm` leaves inline three `componentRefs`:

- `slinky-slurm-operator-crds` — SchedMD Slinky CRDs
- `slinky-slurm-operator` — the operator and admission webhook
- `slinky-slurm` — the Slinky-managed Slurm cluster instance (Controller / LoginSet / NodeSet / RestApi), with leaf-specific `overrides` (e.g. H100 GRES wiring on the `nodesets.slinky` map)

This is the same shape `dynamo-platform` uses across the `*-inference-dynamo` leaves. See `recipes/overlays/h100-eks-ubuntu-training-slurm.yaml` for the full example.

When authoring a recipe targeting Talos (`criteria.os: talos`), append the `os-talos` mixin to your overlay's `spec.mixins` list (e.g. `spec.mixins: [os-talos]`, or `[platform-kubeflow, os-talos]` if you already mix in a non-OS fragment). OS-scoped mixins are mutually exclusive — combining `os-ubuntu` and `os-talos` in one overlay is a recipe authoring error, not a supported composition. The mixin overrides namespaces for affected components and supplies PSA-privileged Namespace manifests via `componentRefs[].preManifestFiles`, which are applied before each chart — see [Talos integration](talos-integration.md) for the component list and labels.

**Cross-cutting overlays with wildcard criteria** apply across one criteria dimension without being referenced via `spec.base` or listed in `spec.mixins`. The resolver can return multiple independent maximal-leaf overlays for a single query, so a `service: any` overlay is picked up alongside the service-specific maximal leaf and its inheritance chain:

```yaml
# gb200-any.yaml — applies to every GB200 query (any service, any intent)
spec:
  base: base
  criteria:
    service: any         # Wildcard — matches eks, oke, gke, etc.
    accelerator: gb200
  validation:
    deployment:
      checks:
        - operator-health
        - expected-resources
        - gpu-operator-version
        - check-nvidia-smi
      constraints:
        - name: Deployment.gpu-operator.version
          value: ">= v25.10.0"
```

Only use this pattern when the content is truly uniform across the wildcard dimension — if values diverge per service, keep them inline in each service-specific overlay. NCCL performance thresholds, for example, are explicitly **not** a good fit for this pattern: each service has a different network fabric (EFA, TCPXO, RoCE, etc.) and the same bandwidth number is rarely correct across two fabrics. The intent-scoped `gb200-any-training.yaml` and `b200-any-training.yaml` shapes that previously carried cross-service NCCL thresholds were retired (`gb200-any-training` in #1052, `b200-any-training` in #1053) in favor of per-leaf performance blocks. See [Data Architecture](../contributor/recipe.md#criteria-wildcard-overlays) for when to use wildcard overlays vs mixins.

**Merge order:** `base.yaml` (lowest) → intermediate → leaf → mixins (highest)

**Merge rules:**
- Constraints: same-named overridden, new added
- ComponentRefs: same-named merged field-by-field, new added
- `validation.<phase>` blocks merge per-field: `checks` and `constraints` union and deduplicate when non-empty (`constraints` by name, overlay wins on same-name); an explicit empty list (`checks: []` / `constraints: []`) **clears** the inherited list, while an omitted/null field **inherits** it; `nodeSelection` replaced wholesale when set; `timeout`/`infrastructure` overlay-wins-if-non-empty
- Criteria: not inherited (each recipe defines its own)
- Mixin constraints/components must not conflict with the inheritance chain or other mixins

### Inference performance constraints

The `inference-perf` performance check reads named entries from
`validation.performance.constraints`. Two are pass/fail **thresholds**
(comparator values, 10% tolerance applied by the evaluator) and the rest are
optional **inputs** that tune the benchmark per accelerator (bare values, no
comparator):

```yaml
validation:
  performance:
    checks: [inference-perf]
    constraints:
      - name: inference-throughput          # >= only; output tokens/sec
        value: ">= 50000"
      - name: inference-ttft-p99            # <= only; TTFT p99 in ms
        value: "<= 2000"
      - name: inference-model               # optional; HF model ID
        value: Qwen/Qwen3-8B
      - name: inference-concurrency-per-gpu # optional; positive integer
        value: "256"
      - name: inference-routing-mode        # optional; dynamo-router or gateway-epp
        value: dynamo-router
```

`inference-model` and `inference-concurrency-per-gpu` resolve with precedence
**recipe constraint > `AICR_INFERENCE_PERF_*` catalog env > compiled default**
(Qwen3-8B at 256/GPU). Set them per overlay to pick the right model and load for
each accelerator — exactly as the throughput/TTFT thresholds already vary per
overlay — while the compiled defaults cover overlays that omit them. Because the
thresholds are only meaningful at a specific model + concurrency, pin all four
together in an overlay rather than relying on the global defaults for the inputs.
`inference-routing-mode` resolves from the recipe only, defaulting to
`dynamo-router`; set `gateway-epp` to validate the GAIE/EPP path through the
AICR-managed inference gateway.

### Component Types

**Helm components** (most common):
```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: gpu-operator
    type: Helm
    version: v26.3.2
    valuesFile: components/gpu-operator/values.yaml
    overrides:
      driver:
        version: "580.82.07"
```

#### Kustomize components

```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: my-app
    type: Kustomize
    source: https://github.com/example/my-app
    tag: v1.0.0
    path: deploy/production
```

A component must have either `helm` OR `kustomize` configuration, not both.

> **`patches` is not supported.** The `componentRefs[].patches` field is not
> applied by any deployer. An enabled ref that sets `patches` is rejected at
> recipe resolution (rather than silently producing an unpatched bundle), so do
> not use it. See [#1588](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/issues/1588).

## Component Configuration

### Configuration Patterns

**Pattern 1: ValuesFile only** (large, reusable configs)
```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: cert-manager
    valuesFile: components/cert-manager/eks-values.yaml
```

**Pattern 2: Overrides only** (small, recipe-specific configs)
```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: nvsentinel
    overrides:
      namespace: nvsentinel
      sentinel:
        enabled: true
```

**Pattern 3: Hybrid** (shared base + recipe tweaks)
```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: gpu-operator
    valuesFile: components/gpu-operator/eks-gb200-training.yaml
    overrides:
      driver:
        version: "580.82.07"  # Override just this field
```

### Value Merge Precedence

Values merge from lowest to highest precedence:

```
Base → ValuesFile → Overrides → CLI --set flags
```

**Deep merge:** only specified fields replaced, unspecified preserved. Arrays replaced entirely (not element-by-element).

**Example:**
```yaml
# Base: driver.version="550.54.15", driver.repository="nvcr.io/nvidia"
# ValuesFile: driver.version="570.86.16"
# Override: driver.version="580.13.01"
# Result: driver.version="580.13.01", driver.repository="nvcr.io/nvidia" (preserved)
```

**Snapshot-driven override — `gpu-operator.driver.enabled`.** When a recipe is resolved from a snapshot (via `aicr recipe --snapshot` or `ResolveRecipeFromSnapshot`), AICR reads the sampled GPU node's `driver-loaded` measurement and injects `gpu-operator.overrides.driver.enabled=false` when the NVIDIA kernel module is already loaded on the node — as an Overrides entry, so it wins over base and provider values files. Explicit CLI `--set` flags retain higher precedence and can supersede the injection. The gate: injection only fires when the resolved overlay already declares the coordinated preinstalled-driver profile (`gpu-operator.driver.enabled=false` in the merged base+valuesFile) — that scopes auto-detect to overlays like GKE-COS and OKE, and skips bare AKS/EKS with a warning instead of leaving the Operator half-configured. Policy is only-false (never forces `true`), so recipes resolved without a snapshot fall back to today's static defaults. Capture the snapshot **before** deploying the GPU Operator: a snapshot taken after a prior AICR-managed driver install still reports `driver-loaded=true` and would flip a re-deploy toward driverless nodes; AICR emits a warning when both `driver-loaded=true` and a gpu-operator ClusterPolicy are present in the snapshot. See [Component Catalog › GPU Operator Driver Auto-Detect](../user/component-catalog.md#gpu-operator-driver-auto-detect).

## Disable a Component in an Overlay

Set `overrides.enabled: false` on a `componentRef` to drop a component a base
recipe would otherwise install. Use this when the target platform already
provides that component — for example a CSP-managed cert-manager on OKE, where
installing a second copy would conflict.

```yaml
# Leaf overlay: the platform supplies cert-manager, so don't install ours.
componentRefs:
  - name: cert-manager
    overrides:
      enabled: false
```

A disabled component is excluded from the recipe's `deploymentOrder` and from
the generated bundle. A dependency edge pointing at it is treated as **already
satisfied** (the component is assumed provided externally), so components that
declare it in `dependencyRefs` — such as `gpu-operator` — still resolve and
order correctly instead of failing with a circular-dependency error. A
`dependencyRefs` entry that names a component which does not exist in the recipe
at all is still an error.

The disabled `componentRef` remains in the resolved recipe's `componentRefs`
(with `overrides.enabled: false`) for transparency, but it cannot be re-enabled at
bundle time — `--set <component>:enabled=true` on a recipe-disabled component
is rejected, because re-enabling a platform-provided component would install a
conflicting second copy. Disabling is therefore an authoring decision: to ship
the component, remove the `enabled: false` override from the recipe/overlay.
See [Enable or disable components](../user/bundling.md#enable-or-disable-components).

## File Naming Conventions

File names are for human readability—matching uses `spec.criteria`, not file names.

**Overlay naming:** `{accelerator}-{service}-{os}-{intent}-{platform}.yaml` (platform always last)

| File Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Service | `{service}.yaml` | `eks.yaml` |
| Service + intent | `{service}-{intent}.yaml` | `eks-training.yaml` |
| Full criteria | `{accel}-{service}-{os}-{intent}.yaml` | `gb200-eks-ubuntu-training.yaml` |
| + platform | `{accel}-{service}-{os}-{intent}-{platform}.yaml` | `gb200-eks-ubuntu-training-kubeflow.yaml` |
| Mixin (OS) | `os-{os}.yaml` | `os-ubuntu.yaml` |
| Mixin (platform) | `platform-{platform}.yaml` | `platform-kubeflow.yaml` |
| Component values | `values-{service}-{intent}.yaml` | `values-eks-training.yaml` |

## Constraints and Validation

### Constraints

Constraints validate deployment requirements against cluster snapshots:

```yaml
constraints:
  - name: K8s.server.version
    value: ">= 1.32.4"
  - name: OS.release.ID
    value: ubuntu
  - name: OS.release.VERSION_ID
    value: "24.04"
```

#### Common measurement paths

| Path | Example |
|------|---------|
| `K8s.server.version` | `1.32.4` |
| `OS.release.ID` | `ubuntu`, `rhel` |
| `OS.release.VERSION_ID` | `24.04` |
| `GPU.hardware.model` | `h100`, `l40s` |

**Operators:** `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, or exact match (no operator)

**Add constraints when:** recipe needs specific K8s features, driver versions, OS capabilities, or hardware. Skip when universal or redundant with component self-checks.

### Validation Phases

Optional multi-phase validation beyond basic constraints:

```yaml
# expectedResources are declared on componentRefs, not under validation
componentRefs:
  - name: gpu-operator
    type: Helm
    expectedResources:
      - kind: Deployment
        name: gpu-operator
        namespace: gpu-operator
      - kind: DaemonSet
        name: nvidia-driver-daemonset
        namespace: gpu-operator

validation:
  # Readiness phase has no checks — constraints are evaluated inline from snapshot.
  deployment:
    checks: [expected-resources]
  performance:
    infrastructure: nccl-doctor
    checks: [nccl-bandwidth-test]
```

**Phases:** `deployment`, `performance`, `conformance` (readiness constraints are evaluated implicitly)

### Testing

```bash
# Validate constraints
aicr validate --recipe recipe.yaml --snapshot snapshot.yaml

# Phase-specific
aicr validate --recipe recipe.yaml --snapshot snapshot.yaml --phase deployment

# Run validation tests
go test -v ./pkg/recipe/... -run TestConstraintPathsUseValidMeasurementTypes
```

## Working with Recipes

### Adding a New Recipe

**When:** new platform, hardware, workload type, or combined criteria

**Steps:**
1. Create overlay in `recipes/overlays/` with criteria and componentRefs
2. If the recipe shares OS constraints or platform components with other overlays, reference existing mixins via `spec.mixins` instead of duplicating (or create new mixins in `recipes/mixins/`)
3. Create component values files if using `valuesFile`
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Test generation: `aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format yaml`

**Example:**
```yaml
# recipes/overlays/gb200-eks-ubuntu-training.yaml
apiVersion: aicr.run/v1alpha2
kind: RecipeMetadata
metadata:
  name: gb200-eks-ubuntu-training
spec:
  base: eks-training
  criteria:
    service: eks
    accelerator: gb200
    os: ubuntu
    intent: training
  componentRefs:
    - name: gpu-operator
      version: v26.3.2
      valuesFile: components/gpu-operator/eks-gb200-training.yaml
```

### Updating Recipes

**Updating versions:**
```yaml
# Update component version
componentRefs:
  - name: gpu-operator
    version: v26.3.2  # Changed from v26.3.1
```

**Adding components:**
```yaml
componentRefs:
  - name: new-component
    version: v1.0.0
    valuesFile: components/new-component/values.yaml
    dependencyRefs: [existing-component]  # Optional
```

**Test changes:** `aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format yaml`

### Adding a Component Readiness Gate

A component can declare a **readiness gate** so that, when a bundle is built with `aicr bundle --readiness-hooks`, the deploy blocks until a component-specific signal is actually healthy — not just until the chart's own resources report Ready. This matters for operators whose true readiness lives in a custom resource the deployer can't assess natively (e.g. `gpu-operator`'s `ClusterPolicy` reaching `status.state: ready`).

**Convention:** drop a [Chainsaw](https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/) `Test` at `recipes/components/<name>/readiness.yaml`. There is no registry field to set — the bundler discovers the file by path. Components without one are simply not gated.

```yaml
# recipes/components/gpu-operator/readiness.yaml
apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: gpu-operator-readiness
spec:
  # The gate CLI owns the outer retry/poll loop, so a single assert only needs
  # a short window to confirm the current state.
  timeouts:
    assert: 30s
  steps:
    - name: clusterpolicy-ready
      try:
        - assert:
            resource:
              apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1
              kind: ClusterPolicy
              status:
                state: ready
```

When `--readiness-hooks` is set, the bundler wraps this test into a `NNN-<name>-readiness/` folder containing a `Job` that runs the `gate` CLI (`ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr-gate`, which embeds Chainsaw). The deploy blocks on that Job — via `helm --wait` for the helm deployer (the gate Job is a `post-install,post-upgrade` hook, and `--wait` blocks on hook completion regardless of `--wait-for-jobs`), or via Argo CD's built-in `batch/Job` health on the next sync-wave for the `argocd`/`argocd-helm` deployers. Keep `spec.timeouts.assert` shorter than the gate's per-test timeout so a single poll can't outlast one gate iteration. See [Readiness Gates](../user/cli-reference.md#readiness-gates) for the deploy-time behavior.

## Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use minimum criteria fields needed for matching
- Keep base recipe universal and conservative
- Use mixins for shared OS constraints or platform components instead of duplicating across leaf overlays
- Always explain why settings exist (1-2 sentences)
- Follow naming conventions (`{accel}-{service}-{os}-{intent}-{platform}`)
- Run `make test` before committing
- Test recipe generation after changes

**Don't:**
- Add environment-specific settings to base
- Over-specify criteria (too narrow = fewer matches)
- Create duplicate criteria combinations
- Duplicate OS or platform content across leaf overlays (use mixins instead)
- Skip validation tests
- Forget to update context when values change

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Tests

Tests in [`pkg/recipe/yaml_test.go`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/pkg/recipe/yaml_test.go) validate:
- Schema conformance (YAML structure)
- Criteria enum values (service, accelerator, intent, OS, platform)
- File references (valuesFile, dependencyRefs)
- Constraint syntax (measurement paths, operators)
- No duplicate criteria
- Merge consistency
- No dependency cycles

### Running Tests

```bash
make test  # All tests
go test -v ./pkg/recipe/...  # Recipe tests only
go test -v ./pkg/recipe/... -run TestAllMetadataFilesConformToSchema  # Specific test
```

### Test Workflow

1. Create recipe file in `recipes/`
2. Run `make test` to validate
3. Test generation: `aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format yaml`
4. Inspect bundle: `aicr bundle -r recipe.yaml -o ./test-bundles`

Tests run automatically on PRs, main pushes, and release builds.

## Advanced Topics

### External Data Sources

Integrators can extend or override embedded recipe data using the `--data` flag without modifying the OSS codebase. This enables:
- Custom recipes for proprietary hardware
- Private component values with organization-specific settings
- Extended registries with internal Helm charts
- Rapid iteration without rebuilding binaries
- New criteria values (service / accelerator / OS / intent / platform) admitted at runtime via the catalog-driven [criteria registry](data-extension.md#adding-a-criteria-value) — no rebuild required

See [Data Extension](data-extension.md) for the full walkthrough (folder layout, registry rules, strict mode, debugging). The summary below is for quick reference.

#### Directory structure

```
./my-data/
├── registry.yaml              # Extends/overrides component registry
├── overlays/
│   └── custom-recipe.yaml     # New or override existing recipe
├── mixins/
│   └── os-custom.yaml         # Custom mixin fragments
└── components/
    └── my-operator/
        └── values.yaml        # Component values
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Recipe generation
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --data ./my-data --output recipe.yaml

# Bundle generation
aicr bundle --recipe recipe.yaml --data ./my-data --deployer argocd --output ./bundle

# Debug loading
aicr --debug recipe --service eks --data ./my-data
```

**Precedence:** Embedded data (lowest) → External data (highest)

**Behavior:**
- Overlays: Same `metadata.name` replaces embedded
- Registry: Merged; same-named components replaced
- Values: External valuesFile references take precedence
- Criteria values: External overlays' `spec.criteria` values become valid CLI / API inputs at runtime via the criteria registry; `--criteria-strict` (or `AICR_CRITERIA_STRICT=1`) rejects external-only values for OSS CI gates

**Validation:**
```bash
aicr --debug recipe --service eks --data ./my-data --output /dev/stdout
aicr recipe --service eks --data ./my-data --format json | jq '.metadata.appliedOverlays'
```

### Regional registry overrides

A handful of components ship images from regional, account-scoped container registries rather than a single public URI. The clearest example today is the AWS EFA device plugin, whose canonical home is `<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/eks/aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin` — a per-region private ECR that every EKS node is auto-authorized to pull from. AWS publishes these add-ons regionally for three reasons: pulls go over the AWS internal backbone (no NAT egress), no Docker Hub / public-registry rate limits, and the image stays available even when the public internet or another region is degraded.

AICR ships a sensible default for each such image (e.g., us-west-2 for `aws-efa`), but customers deploying in a different region need to override the registry's region segment. Two override paths cover the common cases:

**Bundle-time override (single region per bundle).** Use `--set` to bake a specific region into the bundle:

```bash
aicr bundle --recipe recipe.yaml \
  --set awsefa:image.repository=602401143452.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks/aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin \
  -o ./bundle
```

**Install-time override (one bundle, many regions).** Use `--dynamic` to declare the path as install-time-fillable, then provide the value via `helm install --set` (or your GitOps tool):

```bash
aicr bundle --recipe recipe.yaml \
  --dynamic awsefa:image.repository \
  --deployer helm \
  -o ./bundle

# Per-cluster install
helm install ... --set image.repository=602401143452.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eks/aws-efa-k8s-device-plugin
```

`--dynamic` is supported with `helm`, `argocd-helm`, and `flux` deployers; `argocd` does not support it (use `argocd-helm` instead). See [Dynamic Install-Time Values](../user/cli-reference.md#dynamic-install-time-values) for the broader pattern.

**Partition-aware variants.** Standard AWS uses account ID `602401143452`. GovCloud and China use different accounts and URI suffixes:

| Partition | Account ID | URI shape |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| `aws` (standard) | `602401143452` | `<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com` |

## Troubleshooting

**Debug overlay matching:**
```bash
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format json | jq '.metadata.appliedOverlays'
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format json | jq '.componentRefs[].version'
```

**Common issues:**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Test: "duplicate criteria" | Combine overlays or differentiate criteria |
| Test: "valuesFile not found" | Create file or fix path in recipe |
| Test: "unknown component" | Use registered bundler name |
| Recipe returns empty | Check criteria fields match query |
| Wrong values in bundle | Verify merge precedence (base → valuesFile → overrides) |

**Validation:**
```bash
make qualify  # Full qualification
make test     # All tests
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --format yaml  # Test generation
```

## Submitting Your Recipe

Recipes that target hardware AICR maintainers cannot independently
re-run require an **evidence bundle** so a reviewer can verify the
recipe without owning the hardware. The bundle is a signed,
OCI-distributed artifact that captures the resolved recipe, the
cluster snapshot, the validator phase results, a CycloneDX BOM, and
a manifest of per-file hashes. It is produced by adding two flags to
the same `aicr validate` invocation you already use to check the
recipe — no separate build step.

### When You Need Evidence

You need an evidence bundle when your PR adds or changes a recipe
whose `criteria` reach hardware or a service that AICR maintainers
cannot independently re-run — most non-H100 GPUs, non-EKS services,
and specialty fabrics fall into this bucket. The recipe-evidence CI
gate posts a sticky Markdown comment on every PR touching
`recipes/**` and flags (warning-only — it does not block merge) any
touched recipe that has no matching per-source pointer under
`recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/`.

The proposed material-slice canonicalization aims to let non-material
edits (comments, formatting, `displayName`, `description`, key-order)
reuse an existing pointer without a fresh bundle. That semantic slice
is **not yet implemented** — today's verifier hashes the normalized
full recipe, so the collapse-to-same-digest behavior is target state,
not current. See
[ADR-007 § Material-slice canonicalization](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/docs/design/007-recipe-evidence.md#material-slice-canonicalization-proposed)
for the proposed slice definition.

### Producing the Bundle

Run `aicr validate` against the cluster that exercises your recipe
and add `--emit-attestation` (writes the bundle to disk) and
`--push` (signs and uploads the OCI artifact):

```bash
# 1. Capture snapshot and resolve the recipe you're contributing.
aicr snapshot --output snapshot.yaml
aicr recipe --service eks --accelerator gb200 --os ubuntu \
            --intent training --output recipe.yaml

# 2. Validate with attestation emission. Replace the OCI ref with a
#    registry you control (GHCR, GitLab Container Registry, Harbor,
#    AWS ECR, Google Artifact Registry, Azure Container Registry,
#    or JFrog Artifactory — any OCI 1.1 registry with Referrers API
#    support).
aicr validate \
  --recipe recipe.yaml \
  --snapshot snapshot.yaml \
  --emit-attestation ./out \
  --push ghcr.io/<owner>/aicr-evidence

# 3. Commit the SIGNED pointer. The bundle bytes live in OCI; the repo
#    only stores the locator. The blocking Evidence Pointer Contract gate
#    requires a signed pointer committed under the per-source tree
#    recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/<digest>.yaml — NOT a flat
#    recipes/evidence/<recipe>.yaml. <src> is the signer slug
#    (SourceSlug = first 32 hex of sha256(issuer\nidentity)); <digest> is
#    the bundle digest with ':' rewritten to '-'. Don't construct it by
#    hand: step 2 already logged the exact destination as the `copyTo`
#    field of its "evidence pointer written" line, e.g.
#      copyTo=recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/sha256-<digest>.yaml
DEST=recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/sha256-<digest>.yaml   # from the copyTo log line
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$DEST")"
cp ./out/pointer.yaml "$DEST"
git add "$DEST"
```

> **The signer must be allowlisted.** The blocking *Evidence Pointer Contract*
> gate rejects a committed pointer whose signer is not listed in
> `recipes/evidence/allowlist.yaml` ("signer … is not in the allowlist; add a
> community/partner entry"). A maintainer adds your verified signer (keyed by
> its one-way `source` slug, or an anchored `identityPattern` for CI) as a
> `community`/`partner` entry — coordinate this in your PR; the pointer cannot
> merge until the entry exists.

`--push` signs the bundle (cosign keyless via Sigstore) and attaches it to the
OCI artifact as a Sigstore Bundle referrer. The tag is just a label — the
bundle is pinned by its `sha256:` digest — so omitting it lets aicr derive a
unique per-recipe tag (`<recipe-slug>-<short-fingerprint>`, e.g.
`gb200-eks-ubuntu-training-3f9a1c2b4d5e`).

precedence, and registry compatibility notes, see
[Emitting recipe evidence](../user/validation.md#emitting-recipe-evidence).

[Recipe Evidence Demo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/demos/evidence.md).

### Self-Verifying Before You Open the PR

Run the verifier locally — it is the same code the warning-only
recipe-evidence verify gate runs against the committed pointer. (A
second, **blocking** *Evidence Pointer Contract* gate also checks that
the committed pointer is signed and correctly placed under
`recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/<digest>.yaml`; signing locally and
committing the nested pointer, as above, satisfies it.) A clean local
run keeps the sticky comment green:

```bash
# Verify the emitted pointer before committing it...
aicr evidence verify ./out/pointer.yaml
# ...or the committed nested pointer after copying it into place:
aicr evidence verify recipes/evidence/<recipe>/<src>/<digest>.yaml
```

Exit 0 means the signature verified, the predicate parsed, every
manifest/file hash matched, and the per-phase CTRF report digests
matched the predicate. The fingerprint and BOM are only *surfaced*
in the report (signer identity, fingerprint dimensions, phase counts,
BOM info) — they are not cross-checked against the recipe criteria or
registry. A non-zero exit writes a structured
Markdown report describing the specific check that failed. See
[`aicr evidence verify`](../user/cli-reference.md#aicr-evidence-verify)
for the full check list and exit-code semantics.

### What to Include in the PR

The recipe-evidence CI gate posts a Markdown summary as a sticky
comment, so you do not need to inline the verifier output. The
[PR template](https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
has no dedicated evidence section, so add the following three pieces of
context the verifier cannot infer to the PR description (the Summary or
Implementation Notes section is fine):

- **The OCI ref** of the pushed bundle, digest-pinned, so a
  maintainer can audit it directly:
  `ghcr.io/<owner>/aicr-evidence@sha256:<digest>`.
- **The cluster you attested from** — cloud, accelerator SKU, OS,
  Kubernetes version, node count. The fingerprint dimensions are in
  the predicate, but the human description is what the maintainer
  reads first.
- **Evidence disposition.** If `aicr evidence verify` reported a
  non-zero exit with a `1` in the JSON output's `exit` field
  (signature valid, recorded phase results show failures), include a
  short justification in the PR description. The maintainer either applies the `evidence/known-failure`
  label (not yet created — future state) and merges, or requests changes. See
  [Exit-1 Review Process](../contributor/maintaining.md#exit-1-review-process)
  for what counts as an acceptable reason — broadly: optional check
  not applicable to your hardware, performance ceiling limited by
  your test bed, or a validator under known active rework.

### If You Cannot Push to a Registry

You can still produce a bundle locally without `--push`. The
resulting `./out/summary-bundle/` directory is unsigned but
otherwise complete:

```bash
aicr validate --recipe recipe.yaml --snapshot snapshot.yaml \
  --emit-attestation ./out
aicr evidence verify ./out/summary-bundle
```

The verifier records the signature step as "skipped (unsigned)" and
the manifest-hash chain becomes self-consistency only — useful for
catching accidental corruption during development, but **not
acceptable for the CI gate**, which requires a signed bundle bound
to a committed pointer.

- For mechanical changes that touch `recipes/**` but carry no
  recipe semantics (file renames, comment-only changes, license
  header sweeps, self-bootstrapping evidence-pipeline changes), ask
  a maintainer to apply `evidence/exempt` (not yet created — future state) per the
  [bypass policy](../contributor/maintaining.md#evidenceexempt-bypass-policy).
  Self-applying that label is not appropriate.

"I don't have the hardware right now, please merge" is **not** a
valid exempt path — see the bypass policy's "Inappropriate uses."
