# ADR-012: Recipe → Board-Coordinate Mapping

## Status

Accepted. `pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor` ships the ratified mapping; consumers may
import it as a stable contract.

## Problem

Multiple workstreams need to answer the same question — *where does this recipe
live on the validation board?* — and they must all answer it identically. The
TestGrid track (#1266–#1273) emits per-recipe build results into a board; RQ1
(#1283) deep-links from the recipe-health Evidence column into that board; GP4
(#1404) and GP5 (#1405) expose and render the board. If each of these computed
its own service/accelerator/intent placement, the four surfaces would drift the
moment any one of them changed a delimiter, a wildcard rule, or a segment order.

Two failure modes follow from an unowned mapping:

- **Independent forks diverge.** The recipe `metadata.name` is
  accelerator-first (`h100-eks-ubuntu-training`); the board coordinate is
  service-first (`eks/h100-ubuntu/training`). Anyone who derives the coordinate
  by string-munging the name will eventually produce a different layout than a
  peer who derives it from criteria.
- **Ambiguous placement.** Without a fail-closed contract, a recipe missing a
  required dimension (or carrying an `any` wildcard) silently maps to a
  plausible-looking but wrong cell, fusing unrelated results.

This ADR fixes the mapping as a single, pure Go function —
`pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor` — and pins the surrounding taxonomy, URL form, and
column-metadata schema that its consumers share.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- The canonical recipe → coordinate mapping (`pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor`, shipped
  in `pkg/recipe/coordinate.go`).
- The board taxonomy (group / dashboard / tab / row / column).
- The stable coordinate URL form.
- The pinned column-metadata key schema (`started.json` keys).
- Reconciliation with ADR-009 (recipe-health) — how the two surfaces coexist.
- The #1224 cross-link contract that recipe-health consumes.

**Out of scope:**

- The consumers themselves — TG2 (#1267), TG3, TG4a, RQ1 (#1283), GP4 (#1404).
  They *import* this mapping; their internals are owned by their own issues.
- The API and UI that render the board (GP5).
- The live board / hosting / navigation host.
- The user-facing `docs/user/` TestGrid page. It is **deferred**: it has a soft
  dependency on TG4a's served URL form, so it is authored alongside that work
  rather than here. This design spec is the internal contract that unblocks the
  dependent workstreams in the meantime.

## Taxonomy

The board is a five-level addressing space. `CoordinateFor` produces only the
first three levels — the **group, dashboard, and tab** — from resolved recipe
criteria. The **row and column come from the CTRF test data**, not the recipe,
and are out of this function's hands entirely.

| Level | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Group | `service` | recipe criteria (`CoordinateFor`) |
| Dashboard | `<accelerator>-<os>` | recipe criteria (`CoordinateFor`) |
| Tab | `intent`, or `<intent>-<platform>` | recipe criteria (`CoordinateFor`) |
| Row | `<phase>/<check>` | CTRF test data (NOT the recipe) |
| Column | one build | CTRF test data (NOT the recipe) |

Stating this split explicitly matters: a recipe defines *which board cell* a
result belongs in (group/dashboard/tab); the validation run defines *what is in
that cell* (which checks ran, in which build). `CoordinateFor` therefore returns
a three-field `Coordinate{Group, Dashboard, Tab}` and nothing about rows or
columns.

## Mapping rules

The input is **resolved** `Criteria`. The function consumes already-resolved
criteria and **never parses `metadata.name`**. This is deliberate: the recipe
name is accelerator-first and the coordinate is service-first, and the two must
stay *independently* correct — coupling them through string parsing would make a
rename of either silently corrupt the other.

- **Required, concrete dimensions:** `service`, `accelerator`, `os`, `intent`.
  Each must be a concrete value. A `nil` Criteria, an empty value, or the `any`
  wildcard (`CriteriaAnyValue`, the string `"any"`) **fails closed** with
  `ErrCodeInvalidRequest`, naming the offending dimension. A recipe that fails
  this check is *not coordinatable*; callers skip it (it has no board cell).
- **Optional sub-segment — platform only:** `platform` is the single optional
  segment. An empty or `any` platform yields a **bare intent tab** (`training`);
  a concrete platform yields `<intent>-<platform>` (`training-kubeflow`). An
  optional sub-segment is **dropped, never `"unknown"`-substituted** — there is
  no placeholder token in the coordinate.
- **Purity:** the function is pure — no clock, no maps, no registry, no I/O. The
  same Criteria always yields the same Coordinate.
- **Join key:** the value by which recipes are *addressed* across systems is the
  overlay `metadata.name`. The coordinate is the *placement*; the name is the
  *identity*. (`CoordinateFor` does not read the name — addressing happens at the
  caller, which already holds both the name and the resolved criteria.)

This matches the shipped `Coordinate` struct: `Group = service`,
`Dashboard = accelerator + "-" + os`, `Tab = intent` (or `intent-platform`).

## Why Kubernetes version lives in the column

The Kubernetes version is **not** part of the coordinate. It lives **in the
column** (one build = one k8s version). Three facets of this decision must be
held together:

1. **Benefit — stable, addressable links.** Because k8s is a property of the
   *build*, the coordinate (`eks/h100-ubuntu/training`) is invariant across k8s
   versions. RQ1's deep-links and TG4a's exposed paths stay stable as clusters
   upgrade; the link target does not churn every time a new K8s minor ships.
2. **Cost — silent fusion.** The flip side: two columns for the *same*
   coordinate but *different* k8s versions sit in the same tab. A stale-version
   result could be read alongside a current-version result and silently fuse in
   a reader's mind into one "this recipe's posture" signal, even though one of
   them is no longer relevant.
3. **Countermeasure.** k8s version is exposed as a **UI facet / filter** (so a
   reader can scope to a version), **plus** a **latest-per-signer default
   scope** (so the default view does not mix stale and current results). Both
   the facet and the default scope are required to keep the benefit without
   paying the fusion cost.

## Stable URL form

The canonical coordinate string is:

```text
<group>/<dashboard>/<tab>
```

For example: `eks/h100-ubuntu/training-kubeflow` (with platform) or
`eks/h100-ubuntu/training` (bare intent). This is exactly what
`Coordinate.Path()` (and `String()`) returns.

**`Path()` is a stable *opaque identity*, not a decomposable key.** Dimension
values may themselves contain the `-` join character (`rtx-pro-6000`; a future
`--data` intent such as `fine-tuning`), so `eks/rtx-pro-6000-ubuntu/training`
has no positional split point — a consumer cannot recover `(rtx-pro-6000,
ubuntu)` from the string alone. Consumers therefore treat `Path()` as a value
that is stable and equal-comparable (deep-links, presence checks) and address
the dimensions via the `Coordinate` struct fields, **never** by string-splitting
the path. A decomposable key would require an explicit `ParseCoordinate`; that
is deferred to the first parsing consumer (RQ1 #1283 / TG4a #1284), which would
also pin a "values must not contain the active delimiter" invariant.

The one delimiter the mapping *does* enforce is `/`: `CoordinateFor` fails closed
(`ErrCodeInvalidRequest`) on any dimension value containing `/`, because the path
separator is the single character whose presence would change the segment count
and silently mis-place the recipe — the exact ambiguous-placement failure this
ADR exists to prevent.

This string is the canonical coordinate that RQ1 deep-links to and that TG4a / GP
expose. **The host and the navigation scheme (path vs. fragment) are owned by the
consumer** (GP5 / TG4a), not by this mapping. `pkg/recipe` emits only the
canonical segments; it makes no assumption about scheme, host, or trailing
decoration.

## Pinned column-metadata key schema

Each build column carries a fixed set of metadata keys in its `started.json`.
This schema is **specified here and enforced by TG2 (#1267)** — the emitter — and
referenced by **TG3's `Header.extra`**; no Go constant or struct pins these names
today, so TG2 must lock the key names, order, and count (e.g. in a shared
constant + a round-trip test) when it lands, rather than relying on this prose.
The contract is **7 keys**, in this order. The strings below are the canonical
`snake_case` key names; consumers use them verbatim.

| # | Key | Source | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `aicr_version` | binary that ran the validation | `v0.42.0` | The `aicr` release that produced the result. |
| 2 | `k8s_version` | observed cluster | `1.33` | Observed cluster version, `major.minor` only — drives the k8s-in-column facet. |
| 3 | `k8s_constraint` | recipe | `>= 1.32.4` | The recipe-declared `K8s.server.version` constraint, for at-a-glance "did the observed version satisfy intent?". |
| 4 | `signer_identity` | attestation | `https://github.com/NVIDIA/aicr/.github/workflows/...` | Signer identity (the SAN / subject of the signing identity). |
| 5 | `signer_issuer` | attestation | `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com` | Signer OIDC issuer — pairs with identity to scope the latest-per-signer default. |
| 6 | `source_class` | provenance | `ci` | Source class (e.g. `ci` vs. ad-hoc / local), so a reader can weigh trust. |
| 7 | `evidence_digest` | evidence | `sha256:…` | Digest of the underlying evidence artifact — the verifiable anchor for the result. |

Notes:

- `k8s_version` is **observed** (what the cluster actually reported);
  `k8s_constraint` is **declared** (what the recipe asked for). Keeping both
  distinct is what lets the board show satisfied-vs-violated without re-resolving
  the recipe.
- `signer_identity` + `signer_issuer` together key the **latest-per-signer**
  default scope referenced in the k8s-in-column countermeasure.
- The key strings and their count (7) are the contract: TG2 emits exactly these;
  TG3 reads exactly these. Adding a key is a change to this table.

## Reconciliation with ADR-009 — coexist, not identity

This board and the recipe-health surface in
[ADR-009](009-recipe-health-tracking.md) are **two surfaces that coexist; they do
not duplicate each other**, and neither is the other's source.

- **recipe-health (ADR-009, [`docs/user/recipe-health.md`](../user/recipe-health.md))**
  owns the **offline structural / freshness** surface — computed without a live
  cluster, from the recipe catalog itself.
- **TestGrid / this coordinate board** owns the **live validation-posture**
  surface — derived from actual validation runs against real clusters.

ADR-009 fixed this split deliberately under
[its two-axis principle](009-recipe-health-tracking.md#3-the-two-axis-principle-documented-now-validation-axis-deferred):
structural soundness and validation posture "must never collapse into a single
fused score." This coordinate board *is* the home of the deferred
validation-posture axis — it is a *separate* surface, not a richer rendering of
the structural matrix.

The two surfaces share exactly one thing: the **`metadata.name` join key**. Both
enumerate recipes by overlay name — recipe-health (`pkg/health`) via
`MetadataStore.ListCatalog` filtered to leaf overlays (`CatalogEntry.IsLeaf`),
which yields the resolved criteria + leaf name per maximal-leaf overlay, the
[leaf-driven (not cartesian) enumeration](009-recipe-health-tracking.md#enumeration-is-leaf-driven-not-cartesian)
ADR-009 specifies. The coordinate board addresses the same recipes by the same
name, and the coordinate itself is derived from the *resolved criteria* of that
same leaf — so the two surfaces line up on identity without sharing computation.

## #1224 cross-link contract

recipe-health's **Evidence** column will **link** into this coordinate URL — it
will **never duplicate** the board's content. The interface is:

- recipe-health computes a recipe's `metadata.name` and its resolved criteria,
  calls `CoordinateFor`, and emits `Coordinate.Path()` as a link target (the deep
  link is RQ1 / #1283).
- The link is **bot-verifiable** via TG4a's coordinate-presence endpoint (RQ2 /
  #1284): an automated check can confirm the linked coordinate actually exists on
  the board, so the Evidence column never links into a void.

**Status of the recipe-health side:** the structural matrix has **shipped** —
`pkg/health` computes it and [`docs/user/recipe-health.md`](../user/recipe-health.md)
publishes it. Its **Evidence** column is a literal `pending` for every recipe
today: no coordinate deep-link exists yet. This contract is precisely the
*interface* that column will adopt — when the evidence-derived Evidence column
lands (RQ1 / #1283), it consumes `CoordinateFor` + `Coordinate.Path()` exactly as
described here.

## Consumers

The following workstreams **import `pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor`** and must never
fork or reimplement the mapping:

- **TG2 (#1267)** — emits the pinned column metadata; uses the coordinate to
  place build results.
- **TG3** — reads the column metadata via `Header.extra`; uses the coordinate for
  tab/dashboard placement.
- **TG4a** — exposes the coordinate URL form and the coordinate-presence endpoint
  (#1284).
- **RQ1 (#1283)** — deep-links into the coordinate URL from recipe-health.
- **GP4 (#1404)** — exposes the board built on these coordinates.

Single-sourcing the mapping in `pkg/recipe.CoordinateFor` is the **anti-drift
guarantee**: every surface derives the same placement from the same resolved
criteria, so a change to the taxonomy is a one-line change in one function, not a
hunt across five repositories of consumers.
