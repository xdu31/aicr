# Security

NVIDIA is dedicated to the security and trust of our software products and services, including all source code repositories.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through GitHub.**

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

To report a potential security vulnerability in any NVIDIA product:

- **Web**: [Security Vulnerability Submission Form](https://www.nvidia.com/object/submit-security-vulnerability.html)
- **Email**: psirt@nvidia.com
  - Use [NVIDIA PGP Key](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/pgp-key) for secure communication

**Include in your report**:
- Product/Driver name and version
- Type of vulnerability (code execution, denial of service, buffer overflow, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code
- Potential impact and exploitation method

NVIDIA offers acknowledgement for externally reported security issues under our coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy. Visit [PSIRT Policies](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/psirt-policies/) for details.

## Supply Chain Security

AICR (AI Cluster Runtime) provides supply chain security artifacts for all container images:

- **SBOM Attestation**: Complete inventory of packages, libraries, and components in SPDX format
- **SLSA Build Provenance**: Verifiable build information (how and where images were created)

### Deployed Image Inventory and Pinning Policy

Beyond AICR's own runtime images, every cluster deployed by AICR pulls a set
of upstream container images selected by the recipe and the Helm charts it
references. The complete list — chart-by-chart and image-by-image — is
published as a versioned doc artifact and refreshed weekly as upstream
charts evolve:

- [`docs/user/container-images.md`](docs/user/container-images.md) — human
  readable summary of every component, chart, and image AICR can deploy.
- A machine-readable [CycloneDX 1.6][cyclonedx] BOM is produced by `make
  bom` and published as a release asset. Tooling that consumes SBOMs
  (Trivy, Grype, Cosign attestation, in-toto) should prefer the JSON; the
  Markdown is its companion.

**Pinning policy** ([ADR-006][adr-006]) defines AICR's three-layer
contract:

1. **Chart versions** are pinned for every Helm component, with no
   exceptions. `recipes/registry.yaml` MUST declare `defaultVersion`;
   `make bom BOM_STRICT=1` enforces this in CI.
2. **Explicit image overrides** that AICR pins in-tree (in
   `recipes/components/<name>/values.yaml` or embedded manifests) carry
   `@sha256:` digests in addition to tags. Renovate handles digest
   rotation as upstream rebuilds the same tag.
3. **Chart-default sub-images** (the ones the upstream chart pulls
   without AICR overriding) ship at whatever the chart resolves at the
   pinned chart version. Reproducibility for these images is delivered by
   admission-time digest verification rather than per-sub-image overrides
   (see the [supply-chain epic][epic-739] for the roadmap).

**Upstream attestation coverage.** AICR's own runtime images and the
[NVSentinel][nvsentinel] images deployed by AICR ship with full
keyless cosign signatures, SLSA build provenance, and SBOM attestations
verifiable from the public Sigstore Rekor transparency log. Other
NVIDIA-owned images that AICR deploys today (gpu-operator,
network-operator, k8s-dra-driver-gpu, nodewright/skyhook) ship legacy
key-based cosign signatures but do not yet ship keyless signatures,
SLSA provenance, or SBOM attestations. Issues requesting parity have
been filed with each upstream and are tracked under the
[supply-chain epic][epic-739] (Stage 3).

### Trust Guarantees

All AICR artifacts published from tagged releases carry cryptographically
verifiable supply chain guarantees. The table below summarizes what exists
and how it is signed:

| Guarantee | Artifact | Format / Standard | Signing |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Build provenance | Container images | SLSA Build Level 3 (provenance v1) | Sigstore keyless via GitHub Actions OIDC |
| Build provenance | CLI binaries | SLSA Build Provenance v1 (Sigstore bundle) | Cosign keyless, logged to public Rekor |
| Signed SBOM | Container images | SPDX v2.3 JSON attestation | Cosign keyless (Fulcio + Rekor) |
| Embedded SBOM | CLI binaries | SPDX v2.3 JSON (via GoReleaser) | Released alongside attested binary |
| Bundle attestation | `aicr bundle` output | SLSA Build Provenance v1 | Sigstore keyless OIDC (opt-in `--attest`) |
| Recipe / bundle validity | `aicr verify` trust levels | `verified` / `attested` / `unverified` / `unknown` | Checksums + Sigstore trusted root |

`aicr verify` reports one of four trust levels for a bundle: `verified`
(full chain verified, binary identity pinned to NVIDIA CI), `attested`
(chain verified but binary attestation missing or external data used),
`unverified` (checksums valid, `--attest` was not used), and `unknown`
(missing checksums or attestation files).

### Verify an Artifact (Happy Path)

Verify the latest released CLI image against its immutable digest:

```shell
# Resolve the latest release tag to an immutable digest
export TAG=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/NVIDIA/aicr/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name')
export IMAGE="ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr"
export DIGEST=$(crane digest "${IMAGE}:${TAG}")

# Verify build provenance and SBOM attestations
gh attestation verify "oci://${IMAGE}@${DIGEST}" --owner nvidia
# ✓ Verification succeeded!
#   • Build provenance (SLSA v1.0)
#   • SBOM (SPDX)
```

Verify a generated deployment bundle, enforcing the highest trust level:

```shell
aicr verify ./my-bundle --min-trust-level verified
```

### Deep-Dive: Verifying Artifacts

For the full operational reference — resolving digests, inspecting SLSA
provenance and SBOM contents, verifying CLI binary and bundle attestations,
enforcing verification in clusters with Kyverno or the Sigstore Policy
Controller, and offline/air-gapped verification with a local trusted root —
see [Supply Chain Verification](docs/integrator/supply-chain-verification.md).

For full CLI flag documentation, see the
[CLI Reference](docs/user/cli-reference.md#aicr-verify) (`aicr verify`,
`aicr bundle --attest`, `aicr trust update`). For a hands-on walkthrough,
see the [Bundle Attestation Demo](demos/bundle-attestation.md).
